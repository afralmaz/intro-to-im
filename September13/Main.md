Hello! for this week, I was inspired by all the things we learned to create a video game styled art work using the mousePressed and if/ while functioins. I also tried out new things like creating a gradient, using the MouseX and MouseY functioin for shapes to change in specific locations.

I had a lot of fun creating this because it pushed me out of my comfort zone with processing. What I struggled with is finding a way to make the mousePressed option work when clicking a certain object, and not just the screen, which I am still in the process of learning. This made me watch a lot of videos by The Coding Train on youtube, and that helped a lot with basic mistakes I made while coding.

For the gradient background, I found on the processing forum by the username Tfguy44:

https://forum.processing.org/two/discussion/27484/how-to-create-a-linear-gradient-background

I changed the colors of the original code to blue and black.

I also learned how to change the fonts in processing with the help of the Create Font tool, and again, through the processing main website learned how to add it into my project.

For the smiling mushroom function, I found a self portrait ( https://openprocessing.org/sketch/7639/#) that has the same effect, went through the code to see how they were able to do it, and tried it out by myself on my project. For some reason, I was scared to because I didnt think I could do it, but I did! Trying out all these new things in processing makes me want to learn even more. Being able to understand codes without them looking like a foreign language, and incorporating it into my own work is great so far.

For the moving shapes, I looked at the lecture notes to write the functions into processing and changed the speed, shape and position.

What I hope to learn in the coming weeks is how to make shapes vibrate, making a galaxy with processing, and learning how to use the mousePressed function on specific shapes only
